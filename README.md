## Project Version Goals
These are the list of goals for each version of the game. Will be updated as time goes on.

### Pre-Alpha
Very early version of the game. Uses very early programmer art and writing will be entirely placeholder. Systems will be a bit janky but should be expandable.
- Movement, collision and basic interaction systems
- Dialoge system
  - Includes option for visual novel style character expressions
- Basic NPC logic
- Mining and gathering system
- Inventory and the ability to use items from a hotbar
- Basic combat
  - Basic Monsters
### Alpha
Develpment version of the game. Main gameplay loops should be present and usable. Art will still be WIP, but some assets like UI should begin to take shape. Basic writing to get the idea of the tone of the game should be present.
### Beta
Almost complete version of the game. All gameplay features, major and minor should be locked in at this point. Art assets should be in a viewable state, but will still have plenty of WIP. Most writing should be nearing it's final status.
### Release
Final Version. All gameplay features, writing, and art should be done.
